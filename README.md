CSC562 : Final Project - Matchmaking for online multiplayer games using opem-match

Note Project-Code is a repo forked from open match: https://github.com/googleforgames/open-match/

Except for small changes in makefile to create images for the demo the major code change are in the following directories:-

Project-Code/examples/demo  (updated)

Project-Code/examples/functions/golang/deathmatch (created)

I do understand in terms of line of code it is less. But my understanding was the major part of the project was to understand these new technologies work and to learn the ability to use them.
